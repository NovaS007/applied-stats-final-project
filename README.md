# R Markdown Analysis: External Factors vs. Classroom Performance

This final project for my Applied Statistics and Experimental Design class analyzes how external factors impact classroom performance using R and R Markdown. It includes data wrangling, visualizations, and statistical modeling.

## Files

-   `External Factors vs Classroom Performance.Rmd`: The main report
-   `Students_Grading_Dataset.csv`: Raw data pulled from Kaggle
-   `External-Factors-vs-Classroom-Performance.html`: Rendered HTML output

## Languages, IDE, and Packages Used

-   R / R Markdown
-   RStudio
-   tidyverse
-   gridExtra
-   ggplot2
-   dplyr
-   ggpubr

## How to Run This Project

1.  Open the project folder in RStudio.

2.  Open the `External Factors vs Classroom Performance.Rmd` file.

3.  Install required packages\*\* (if you haven’t already) by running:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gridExtra", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "ggpubr"))
```

4.  Knit the R Markdown file by clicking the “Knit” button in RStudio. This will generate the `External-Factors-vs-Classroom-Performance.html` output file.

5.  Alternatively, you can open the existing `External-Factors-vs-Classroom-Performance.html` file directly in your web browser to view the results.
